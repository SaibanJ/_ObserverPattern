# _ObserverPattern
This is an example of the observer design pattern in c++

 An implementation of the observer pattern. This pattern is about 
 changes in state. Think about a battery that incrementally decreases over time
 or a weather application that needs to update its status report periodically.
 The observer pattern is a one to many relational pattern.

 The observer Pattern defines a one to many dependancy between objects
 So that when one object changes state, all of its dependants are notified
 and updated automatically.
